# Selecting a Suitable Machine Learning Algorithm for the Prediction of Solar Radiation
## Introduction
These datasets are meteorological data from the Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation (HI-SEAS) weather station from four months (September through December 2016) between Mission IV and Mission V. The unit of each feature is:
- Solar radiation: watts per meter square
- Temperature: degrees Fahrenheit
- Humidity: percentage
- Barometric pressure: inch of mercury
- Wind direction: degrees
- Wind speed: miles per hour
- Sunrise/sunset: Hawaiian time
## Wrangling Effort
Minimal wrangling was performed on the dataset.
## Result
